Quaid e Azam is the greatest leader of our history. He won a 
separate state of Pakistan and printed his name forever in the
 pages of history. He was a sincere and devoted leader of the
 Muslims. He was an intelligent and lively thinker. He awakened 
the Muslims from their slumber. He told them that they were a 
separate nation from Hindus. They needed a separate state to 
live according to their religion and culture. He impressed upon
 the mind of the Muslims of India the necessity of a separate 
country. His real name was Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He was a 
businessman of Karachi. He was born on 25th Dec 1876 in 
Karachi. He was an intelligent, responsible and serious child.
 He received his early education in Karachi and Bombay. 
In his student life, he observed the rules of discipline, all
 this pointed to his future greatness. After completing his
 education at school, he proceeded to England for higher 
education He was admitted to the degree to bar at law. 
He returned to India in 1896. At that time his father's business
 was not running well. He left Karachi and came to Bombay 
to try his luck. At the same time, he began to take interest in 
politics. It was the time of freedom from the British. In the beginning
, he joined the Indian National Congress but soon left it on seeing the evil
 design of the Hindus. He joined the Muslims League and became its leader
.He collected the Muslims on one platform. He created in them spirit of unity. 
He fought against Hindus and the British. His battle was peaceful. His enemie
s tried to purchase him but he remained undaunted. He was a man of great 
determination. He worked very hard for the nation in spite of his falling health

. The Hindus and the English were equally afraid of his political insight and sound 
character. He made numberless speeches in which he demanded a separate state for
 the Muslims.In 1940 the famous Pakistan Resolution was adopted. It was due to the 
sincere efforts of the Quaid-A-Azam that the British decided to leave India. He got 
Pakistan on the 14th of August1947.He came to Pakistan after its establishment. 
He was called the Father of the Nation. He became its first Governor General. 
Alas! He did not live long to steer the boat of weak and feeble nation. 
He died on 11 September, 1948. It was a sad date for all of us.
